We have added a new region, accessible via `/warp nether`.

To enter this region, you need to be level 100 ⭐ <br>
(Which is also the level where you unlock your own Nether island)

On this island, Ghasts spawn frequently. When you kill them,<br>
you receive more Crystals, which can be used to upgrade your OmniTool.

The purpose of this region is to obtain the newly added generators, which can only be placed on the Nether island,<br>
and only if you have a specific permission, which is obtained by completing the UNIQUE quest at `/warp nether`.<br>
(The quest where you need to kill 500 Ghasts)

‼️ **IMPORTANT:** You can only purchase the netherrack generator from the NPC on the island, not from `/gens`.

Additionally, on this island, you can complete a DAILY quest, which offers various rewards such as:
- Money
- 1st points
- Custom experience (one full level)
---
## SOON..
